1.The code after continue statement is skipped. While break statement terminates the loop
2.For loop is used to iterate over a sequence and it's useful when we know the number of iterations
whereas while loop is used to execute a block of code as long as condition is true and this loop is 
useful when we don't know number of iterations
3.The inner loop will be executed one time for each iteration of the outer loop.
for i in range(3):
    print(f"Outer loop iteration {i}")
    
    # Inner loop
    for j in range(2):
        print(f"  Inner loop iteration {j}")
